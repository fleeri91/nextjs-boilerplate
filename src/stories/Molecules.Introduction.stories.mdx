# Molecules Introduction

In chemistry, molecules are a group of two or more atoms that bind together and demonstrate new qualities. Consider the water molecule.
It’s a combination of hydrogen and oxygen that together, create something new. With Atomic Design, designers can say the same about groups of components.

Atoms don’t make sense as a single component, but they can be combined to form Molecules.
In web development, molecules are small, functional units that have the responsibility to do one thing.
