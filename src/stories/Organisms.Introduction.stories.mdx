# Organisms Introduction

Organisms are the combination of Molecules that work together or even with atoms that compose more elaborate interfaces. At this level, the components begin to have the final shape, but they are still ensured to be independent, portable and reusable enough to be reusable in any content.

They can consist of similar and/or different molecule types. For example, a NavigationBar organism might consist of diverse components like a Logo, PrimaryNavigation, SearchForm, etc.

The Organisms at play can show the same Molecule over and over again, like most card-based lists, or show many different Molecules and Atoms. The bottom line is that Atomic Design means creating a way to design that is almost like a flexible puzzle, where designers can exchange Organisms within the same page according to what is needed.

Building up from Molecules to Organisms encourages creating standalone, portable, reusable components.
