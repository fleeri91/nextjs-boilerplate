# Atoms Introduction

Atoms are the basic building blocks of matter. Applied to web interfaces, atoms are our HTML tags, such as a form label, an input, animations or a button.
Atoms can also include more abstract elements like colour palettes, fonts and even more invisible aspects of an interface like animations.

They can be considered the smallest possible components and can be applied in any context, globally or within other components and Templates,
besides having many states, such as this example of a button: disabled, hover, different sizes, etc.
