## Technology

### Next.js
Next.js is a React framework that gives you building blocks to create web applications.

By framework, we mean Next.js handles the tooling and configuration needed for React, and provides additional structure, features, and optimizations for your application.

You can use React to build your UI, then incrementally adopt Next.js features to solve common application requirements such as routing, data fetching, integrations - all while improving the developer and end-user experience.

Whether you’re an individual developer or part of a larger team, you can leverage React and Next.js to build fully interactive, highly dynamic, and performant web applications.

### Typescript
TypeScript is a syntactic superset of JavaScript which adds static typing.

This basically means that TypeScript adds syntax on top of JavaScript, allowing developers to add types.

### Tailwind
Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework designed to enable users to create applications faster and easier. 

You can use utility classes to control the layout, color, spacing, typography, shadows, and more to create a completely custom component design — without leaving your HTML or writing a single line of custom CSS.

### Storybook
Storybook is a frontend workshop for building UI components and pages in isolation.

### Jest
Jest is a JavaScript-based framework for testing React, React Native and other JavaScript-based applications.
